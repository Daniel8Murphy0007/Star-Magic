**Progress**: 827 of 3000+ terms (27.6% complete)**Unveiling Superconductivity that Unifies the Quantum and Universal Field Equations**

## Overview

Aetheric Propulsion (UQFF-Unified Quantum Field Force) has been developed in a low energy laboratory in Ohio since 2010, initially to discover the hidden secrets of hydrogen and helium.

Star-Magic presents a groundbreaking theoretical framework for understanding the universe through the lens of superconductivity and unified field theory. This work introduces novel concepts including:

- **Universal Gravity (Ug)**: Discrete quantum force ranges with specific logical dependencies
- **SCm (Superconductive Material)**: A hidden element bound within every atom and star
- **Universal Aether**: Non-linear negative time derivations
- **Unified Quantum Field Equation (UQFF)**: A comprehensive equation integrating quantum and gravitational realms

This is a Field Unification challenge to MOND, Lambda-CDM, and a host of other theories!

UQFF has been rigorously validated against updated data from all current top classification models and high energy datasets from all major institutions worldwide, yet remains unpublished until now.

This system begins with an equation of the nucleus of an atom and is linked to cosmological, astronomical, and astrophysical data to unify quantum dynamics.

This system unifies all known mathematical systems and provides stable 26th level polynomial predictive potentials.

This system is a compact quantum calculator that will be capable of distinguishing real from fake, capable of organic code growth (e.g., self_OS) and self-implementation/arrangement according to the "starting-input-command-set" along with subject/robot continual neural/wifi-5 feedback.

## Key Concepts

### Universal Gravity (Ug)

- **Ug1**: Internal dipole strength, driving stellar irregularities
- **Ug2**: Spherical outer field bubble, forming heliospheres
- **Ug3**: Disk of magnetic strings, maintaining planetary orbits
- **Ug4**: Observable interactions between stars and black holes

### SCm - The Hidden Element

A superconductive fundamental material related to Einstein-Bose condensate, bound in every atom and star. While lacking a detectable quantum signature (Qs), it is quantifiable through actions and distance measurements.

### Applications

This unified theory addresses fundamental physics problems including:

- Quantum gravity unification
- Millennium Prize Problems (Navier-Stokes, Yang-Mills)
- Quasar dynamics and black hole interactions
- Planetary orbit stability
- Reactor efficiency potential
