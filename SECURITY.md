# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The Star-Magic project primarily consists of theoretical physics documentation and does not contain executable code that could have traditional software security vulnerabilities. However, we take the integrity and accuracy of our scientific content seriously.

## What to Report

Please report any of the following:

### Content Integrity Issues
- Unauthorized modifications to the theoretical framework
- Potential copyright violations
- Malicious links or content injection
- Repository access issues

### Privacy Concerns
- Exposure of private or sensitive information
- Contact information misuse
- Inappropriate data collection

### Infrastructure Issues
- Compromised repository access
- Suspicious pull requests or commits
- Account security concerns

## How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security concerns to:

**Email**: daniel.murphy00@gmail.com

Please include the following information:
- Type of issue (content integrity, privacy, infrastructure, etc.)
- Description of the security concern
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any suggestions for remediation

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report receipt
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Varies based on severity and complexity

## Security Best Practices

While this is primarily a documentation repository, we follow these practices:

1. **Access Control**: Limited write access to repository
2. **Review Process**: All contributions reviewed before merging
3. **Copyright Protection**: All content properly attributed and protected
4. **Transparency**: Security updates communicated through repository notices

## Scope

This security policy applies to:
- The Star-Magic GitHub repository
- All branches and releases
- Associated documentation and communications
- Project-related infrastructure

## Supported Content

We maintain security for:
- Current version of all theoretical documentation
- Historical versions preserved in git history

## Attribution

We will acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose issues (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).

## Questions
