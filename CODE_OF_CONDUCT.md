# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment for scientific discourse, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a respectful experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the scientific community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Engaging in rigorous but respectful scientific debate
- Providing constructive feedback on theoretical concepts

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Dismissing others' contributions without scientific basis
- Ad hominem attacks instead of addressing scientific arguments
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the repository, issue tracker, discussions, and any other forum where the project community interacts. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at daniel.murphy00@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html

## Scientific Discourse

We encourage rigorous scientific debate and questioning of theoretical concepts. Healthy skepticism and peer review are fundamental to scientific progress. However, all discourse should remain professional and focused on the ideas rather than the individuals presenting them.
