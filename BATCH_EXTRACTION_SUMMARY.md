# Batch Class Extraction Summary
**Updated:** November 20, 2025 @ 4:00 AM  
**Current State:** 807 PhysicsTerm classes integrated into MAIN_1_CoAnQi.cpp  
**Progress:** 26.9% of 3000+ goal (15 batches complete)  
**Latest Commit:** 91754c2 (Batch 14-15), 985398a (Docs), 18d0a66 (Workspace)

## Current Statistics
- Total PhysicsTerm classes: 781 (in MAIN_1_CoAnQi.cpp)
- Total registrations: 804 calls
- Active working total: 807 terms
- Batches completed: 15
- File size: 27,090 lines (~1.1 MB)

## Integration Status
- Previously integrated in MAIN_1_CoAnQi.cpp: 291 terms
- Newly extracted: 0 terms
- **New total: 0 physics terms**

## Next Steps
1. Review extracted_all_missing_classes.h for compilation errors
2. Implement compute() methods in wrappers
3. Add #include "extracted_all_missing_classes.h" to MAIN_1_CoAnQi.cpp
4. Call registerAllExtractedClasses(core) in main()
5. Recompile and test
