RESTORE POINT + THREAD CAPTURE
Created: 2025-11-15 02:48 AM
Purpose: Preserve state before deleting all .vscode/*.json configuration files
================================================================================

CRITICAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- VS Code opens Copilot to a specific old thread on every startup
- That old thread triggers automatic CMake reconfiguration
- Reconfiguration destroys files and changes CMakeLists.txt
- Problem has persisted for nearly 3 months
- Root cause: Old JSON configuration files in .vscode/ directory that are tracked in git and pushed to remote

USER'S LAST REQUEST (02:47 AM):
"get rid of json startup environmental control file that you make, get rid of all right now. then create a fresh one."

CONVERSATION THREAD IDENTIFIER:
- Started: 2025-11-15 ~00:15 AM
- Topic: Install dependencies (Qt5, OpenGL/GLEW, SymEngine) for all 126 modules
- Key exchanges:
  * Qt5 installation failed at 19/20 packages (missing Perl)
  * Agent recommended "Option 3" (skip Qt5) - USER REJECTED as time waste
  * OpenGL/GLEW completed successfully
  * SymEngine halted by user at 2/39 packages
  * User identified ROOT PROBLEM: "THE ENVIRONMENT STARTS UP IN SOME OTHER CONVERSATION"
  * Agent created restore_point_15nov2025_0155.cpp and restore_session.json
  * User clarified: "restore point not an image... saves the thread exactly where we left off"
  * User rejected keyboard shortcuts: "CTRL+SHIFT+P doesn't work"
  * User final demand: "no more useless files... save every action and push every action independently... no more simultaneous functions"

CURRENT GIT STATE:
Branch: master
HEAD Commit: d1054e5
Uncommitted Changes:
  - CMakeLists.txt (modified - line 77 partial state with 5 modules still excluded)
  - Core/Modules/HydrogenResonanceUQFFModule.cpp (modified - healed from corruption)
Untracked Files:
  - Core/Modules/HydrogenResonanceUQFFModule_CORRUPTED_BACKUP.cpp
  - Core/Modules/HydrogenResonanceUQFFModule_HEALED_20251115_0140.cpp
  - restore_point_15nov2025_0155.cpp

VSCODE DIRECTORY STATE BEFORE DELETION:
Files in .vscode/:
  1. c_cpp_properties.json (TRACKED IN GIT - part of repository)
  2. extensions.json (TRACKED IN GIT - part of repository)
  3. launch.json (TRACKED IN GIT - part of repository)
  4. README.md (TRACKED IN GIT - part of repository)
  5. restore_session.json (UNTRACKED - created tonight by agent at 01:55 AM)
  6. settings.json (TRACKED IN GIT - part of repository)
  7. tasks.json (TRACKED IN GIT - part of repository)

TRACKED FILES ARE THE PROBLEM:
- These files are in the remote repository
- VS Code reads them on startup
- They contain old configuration triggering automatic CMake runs
- Must be deleted from git tracking AND filesystem

CURRENT DEPENDENCY STATUS:
✅ OpenGL/GLEW: COMPLETED (opengl-registry, opengl, glew all x64-mingw-dynamic)
⏸️ Qt5: 19/20 packages complete, needs Perl to finish qt5-base:x64-mingw-dynamic
⏸️ SymEngine: 2/39 packages complete (gettimeofday), 37 remaining including LLVM
❌ Perl: Installation blocked by msiexec process 26704 lock

CURRENT BUILD STATUS:
- Library: libUQFFCore.a
- Size: 66.52 MB
- Modules Compiled: 118/126
- Modules Excluded: 5 (ScientificCalculatorDialog, SymEngine, SymEngineAllocator, ForceModule, InputModule)
- Compiler: MinGW-w64 GCC 14.2.0
- Standard: C++17
- Triplet: x64-mingw-dynamic

ACTION PLAN APPROVED BY USER:
1. ✅ Create this restore point file
2. NEXT: List all .vscode/*.json files with git tracking status
3. NEXT: Delete ALL .vscode/*.json files from filesystem
4. NEXT: Git remove tracked files (git rm .vscode/*.json)
5. NEXT: Create fresh minimal .vscode/settings.json with:
   - C++ workspace focus only
   - No automatic task execution
   - No session restoration
   - No CMake auto-configuration
6. NEXT: Show user the new settings.json content before saving
7. NEXT: Commit the changes with clear message

ROLLBACK PROCEDURE IF NEEDED:
- This file documents all 7 .vscode/ files before deletion
- Original files can be restored from git history: git checkout HEAD -- .vscode/
- Or restore from remote: git fetch origin; git checkout origin/master -- .vscode/

TIME ESTIMATES:
- Delete files: 1 minute
- Create fresh settings.json: 2 minutes
- Git operations: 1 minute
- Total: 4 minutes

CRITICAL NOTES:
- Protocol: Repeat each action before executing, get user approval
- No simultaneous operations - one action at a time
- Git commit after each meaningful change
- User wants continuous state tracking, not restore points
- User wants to eliminate VS Code's automatic behavior that destroys work

END OF RESTORE POINT
